# Hero Slider Default Images

Please add three high-quality hero images to this folder with the following names:

1. **dashboard-hero-1.jpg** - Main welcome image (e.g., hotel exterior, lobby, or grand entrance)
2. **dashboard-hero-2.jpg** - Luxury amenities image (e.g., pool, spa, or luxury room)
3. **dashboard-hero-3.jpg** - Premium experience image (e.g., dining, room service, or panoramic view)

## Recommended Specifications:
- **Dimensions**: 1920x800px (or similar wide aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG or WebP for better performance
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display
- **Style**: Professional hotel photography with good lighting

## Temporary Fallback:
If you don't have these images yet, the HeroSlider component will gracefully handle missing images with a gradient fallback.
